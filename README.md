# OldProjects
All my old projects... When I was students.

It's nice to see that almost a code 26 years old still compile and works without 1 line changed :)

READY TO PLAY: 
	- FPC: First compiler I wrote. I did a C compiler but I have to find the source code.

WILL FOLLOW:
	- My X-Windows window manager / GUI Builder ( pure XWindow functions - Full C )
	- My 3D Editor ( Full C )
